In the cmd, you specify the name of the program file you want to run and the inputs
eg
-pr "Hello_World.py" -in 7

In the simulator class, a folder is created to record the results
The idea is that for each input in inputs, we run program(input) and record the time it takes to execute
The runtimes are logged to a text file

I need to figure out now to run other python files from the simulator and run
This is why I have #self.argument.program() and print("Hello World") instead XP
